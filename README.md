# Lab 11: HMM Weather Generation

**Date:** November 7, 2025 | **Module:** 2 | **Week:** 11

## Overview

This lab introduces students to stochastic weather generation using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Students will learn to train HMMs on historical weather data, generate synthetic weather sequences for hydrological modeling, and validate the performance of weather generation models against observations.

## Topics Covered

- Training HMM on historical weather data
- Synthetic weather generation techniques
- Model validation approaches for weather generators
- Statistical properties preservation in synthetic data
- Applications of weather generation in hydrological modeling

## Objectives

- Train Hidden Markov Models on historical weather data
- Generate synthetic weather sequences for hydrological modeling
- Validate weather generation models against observations
- Understand the applications and limitations of stochastic weather generation

## Connection to Problem Sets

This lab builds the weather generation tools that students will use for PS2 Task 5, enabling the creation of synthetic weather ensembles for comprehensive uncertainty analysis in hydrological impact studies.
